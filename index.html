    <h1>Eye of the Tiger</h1>
    <h2>Survivor</h2>
    <p>Risin' up, back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance, 
    now I'm back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive So many times, it happens 
    too fast You change your passion for glory Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the 
    past You must fight just to keep them alive</p>
